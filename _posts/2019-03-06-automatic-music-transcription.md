Music Information Retrieval is the interdisciplinarity field, which among other things consists of signal processing, machine learning, music theory and psychoacoustic. All of these disciplines are connected to achieve the solutions of various tasks, which were given by musical industry observation. These tasks include, for example, personalization and recommendation systems, similarity detection, instrument recognition, music generation or music transcription into symbolic notation (like sheet music).

Our work is focused on one particular task - Automatic Music Transcription using neural networks. The task itself is quite complicated and therefore needs to be decomposed into smaller subproblems, which we will focus on and will try to solve them with deep learning strategies.

## Machine and Deep learning

**Machine learning** (ML) is today one of the most powerful tools to make predictions or classifications, when we work with large data sets. It supports almost all common fields - from image and speech recognition in smartphones to complicated web recommendations and self-driving cars.

It was only a matter of time in order to use ML in Music Information Retrieval. Lot of developers aim to remake the actual methods, that have been stated as effective in different domains, but there is still a larger community of people, who want to make original research [1]. 

## State of the art

As the field of the machine and deep learning grows in power, the AMT becomes more and more popular. In comparison to \cite{Benetos2012}, where authors indicate that it seems like transcription systems reached their limits, recent research is still more challenging. The interesting part of both actual review papers - [2], [3] - is that the problem of multi pitch estimation is not completely solved. For imagination, Dave and Varma perfectly described this problem in [4]:

*The problem of mapping a sound signal from time-frequency domain to a time-f0 domain has turned out to be especially hard in the case of polyphonic signals where several sound sources are active at the same time. Multi-pitch (multiple f0) estimation can be considered as one of the main challenges in the field, as we need to deal with masking, overlapping tones, mixture of harmonic and non-harmonic sources, and the fact that the number of sources might be unknown.*
